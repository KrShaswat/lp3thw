print() - Function prints the value given inside the parenthesis  - Exercise 1
        - can use "" and '' to print strings - Exercise 2
        - can print strings (in "" or '') and the maths ( seperated by , ) - Exercise 3
        - can print varible values and string and math separated by ,  - Exercise 4
        - Can add strings and varibles just by +
        - """ """ works prints everthing inside and we can change lines to set it up

#       - comment operator that tells python to not run the stuff after # - Exercise 2
        - This helps in leaving comments in the code for review - Exercise 2

import  - to import a function library
from    - to import a specific set of function inside a library

argv    - through this we give the script input when we call it
          it needs a extra variable set to save the script.

sys     - library which have functions that interact with the interpreter

open    - opens a file and returns a stream (Streams allow sending and receiving data without using callbacks or low-level protocols and transports.)

open.read()     - method in open to read a file
open.close()    - method to close the opened stream of file
open.truncate() - method to delete everthing inside the file
open.write()    - method to write in a file
open.seek(0,1,2)- it goes to start of the file when 0, 1 to the line were user is, 2 at the end of the file
open.readline() - it reads a line and increments to next line (so, if run again it reads the next line)

int()   - function to return interger datatype of whatever is inside
float() - function returns float value of whatever is inside

 
def name(parameter1, parameter2):
        logic
        return

above is a basic fucntion syntax. functions are when we want to use same set of code again and agian so we name it and call it we required



variables - they are similar to math variables 
          - can save strings, numbers, other varibales, functions (with something they are returning)

f""     - can be used to format in varible values inside a string (i.e inside "" or '' or """ """)

.format - method works similar to f""

input() - takes input from user





'' or "" - can be used to tell ptyhon that the stuff inside should be treated as strings

------- OPERATORS in PYTHON -----------

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

+       - Addition
-       - substraction
*       - Multiplication
/       - Division
%       - Modulus       - gives the remaider from a Division
**      - Exponentiation / to the power of
//      - floor division - returns an integral part of the division

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

=       - to assign a value
+=      - increase the value by one and assign it to the left 
-+      - decrease the value by one and assign it to the left
*=      - Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
/=      - Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
**=     - Raises the variable to a specified power and assigns the result to the variable.
%=      - Computes the modulus of the variable and a value and assigns the result to that variable.
//=     - Floor divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.

RELATIONAL OPERATORS

==      - equal to
!=      - not equal to
>       - greater than
<       - less than
>=      - greater than or equal 
<=      - less than or equal

BOOLEAN OPERATORS

and     - return true or false
or      - "
not     - "
